interacts with OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-realtime-mini, with a websocket, in real time.
The CLI allows users to send messages and receive responses in a streaming format,
simulating the experience of a real-time conversation. Additionally, the CLI supports
function calling, for example: implementing a simple function that multiplies two numbers.`,
