# Real-time GPT-4o-mini CLI

A terminal-based client for interacting with OpenAIâ€™s Realtime API.  
This tool supports user input, function calls, and displays model responses in an interactive, live-updating terminal
interface.

## Installation & Configuration

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yechielb2000/GPT-4o-mini-CLI.git
cd GPT-4o-mini-CLI
go build; go install
chmod +x gpt4omini
./gpt4omini
```

> _Note_: You should have a config.yaml under the same directory with your binary.

You can configure the model and the api you are using via this `config.yaml`.  
The structure of the config yaml is [here](config/config_structure.go).

To configure via cli, you can run:

```shell
./gpt4omini config --help
```

You can set the `model` and the `instructions` for specific session but the default is taken from the
config file.

## Basic Usage

To start a session, You can run:

```shell
./gpt4omini session -t 'session-type'
```

This will create a conversation with the model you chose and with the session type you wanted.

To list all sessions types, you can run:

```shell
./gpt4omini session -s
```

For all flags and usage you can run:

````shell
./gpt4omini session --help
````

## architecture & Design choices

- assets - holds assets like images and videos
- cmd - the command line handlers (using cobra)
- config - the config file (instance, structure and handlers)
- random_tools - just an idea for showing functions that are being used by function calling the with the model.
- session - the Session interface and all session types.
- tests - nothing else here, but in the future we could use this for testing.
- types - holds all responses and events types, The DTOs of our sdk.

The Design is pretty simple. We got the Session interface that shares anything that every session needs to have.  
For example, we use it in `realtime session`.

The BaseSession is very functional and handles a lot for us.
You only need to make a bridge between the user interface and the api. Depends on the session you need and the modality.

The DTOs making was really painful with a lot of try excepts xd. The thing is that their docs are not really helping you
and only shows how the response looks.  
I had to read `openai-python`'s code (it doesn't exist on the go sdk unless I missed it).
So the Event making was the easiest part because you get the json and you can match if with the python sdk...
The client message objects were the worst because I had to run it and expect for an error to see how the api wants to
get it.
anyway, it was fun :)

----
BTW at first I made the events separated from the types because I thought it should be like this and I still think it's
better, but I managed to make one Event struct to contain all the expected data objects from the api (I hope so at least).
So if that's true and there is no more to expand, I would leave it in types.
If there is more than that then I think it should sit under `events` package...

same thing for `builders`. at first, I made a package for building different messages types but in the end I saw that I
don't have much because i managed to put all of them under `ConversationItem`.
So if there is more to expend it should have a `builders` to make different messages with functions.
Right now it sits under the `BaseSession` because im lazy.
